# Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains Python implementations of four fundamental sorting algorithms.

| Algorithm        | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bubble Sort**   | Repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements until the list is sorted.  |
| **Selection Sort**| Selects the smallest element in each iteration and places it in order.     |
| **Insertion Sort**| Builds the sorted list one item at a time by inserting elements in place.  |
| **Merge Sort**    | A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the list and merges sorted parts.|
| **Quick Sort**    | Uses a pivot to partition the list and recursively sort sublists.          |
